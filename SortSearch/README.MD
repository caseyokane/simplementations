# SortSearch Directory

A folder to contain implementations of data structures and searching methods for review purposes

### Current contents

SortSearch: A directory that will contain implementations of simple sorting and search algorithms.

1. bubble.c - Simple C implementation of bubble sort using swap method and 2D for loop

2. quicksort.c - C implementation of the quick sort algorithm with same helper functions as bubble.c 

3. mergesort.c - C implementation of the merge sort algorithm

### Compilation/Execution
TODO: Include compilation instructions when proper executable is being generated
